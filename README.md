### Hola! Welcome to my GitHub page, I am Juan Cruz Fernandez 👋

Here you will find projects and workshops that I did during the Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at Concordia University. These projects showcase all the different technologies I have learned including React.js, Javascript ES6, HTML/JSX, DOM, CSS, Node.js, Express and MongoDB.  

My background is quite diverse ranging from working in the film industry as a freelance sound engineer for 7+ years, to starting a micro-brewery in Buenos Aires, Argentina along with 3 other partners. 

When I am not coding I love to rock climb 🧗 and being in the outdoors 🏕️
